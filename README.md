This repository is hosting tools to curate PET brain data using the [Brain Imaging Data Structure Specification](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/04-modality-specific-files/09-positron-emission-tomography.html). The work to create these tools is funded by [Novo Nordisk fonden](https://novonordiskfonden.dk/en/) (NNF20OC0063277) and the [BRAIN initiative](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/) (MH002977-01).

For DICOM conversion, we rely on [dcm2niix](https://www.nitrc.org/plugins/mwiki/index.php/dcm2nii:MainPage), collaborating with Prof. Chris Rorden without whom we could not convert your data! For more information on dcm2niix and nifti please see [The first step for neuroimaging data analysis: DICOM to NIfTI conversion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26945974) paper.

## Installation

Simply download the repository - follow the specific Matlab or Python explanations. Matlab and Python codes provide the same functionalities.

### matlab

Under the /matlab folder, you will find the source code to use - simply add that folder your Matlab(R) path to start using the different functions.

### pypet2bids

Under the /pypet2bids folder,  you will find the source code to use - follow the installation instruction in /pypet2bids/pypet2bids/README.md.

### spreadsheet_conversion (custom and pmod)

This folder contains spreadsheets templates and examples of metadata and matlab and python code to convert them to json files. Often, metadata such as Frame durations, InjectedRadioactivity, etc are stored in spreadsheets and we have made those function to create json files automatically for 1 or many subjects at once to go with the nifti imaging data. Note, we also have conversion for pmod files (also spreadsheets) allowing to export to blood.tsv files.

### metadata

A small collection of json files for our metadata information. 

### ecat_validation

This folder contains code generating Siemens HRRT scanner data using ecat file format and validating the matlab and python conversion tools (i.e. giving the data generated as ecat, do our nifti images reflect acurately the data).
